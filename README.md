## Hey there, I'm Marcus 👋🏼

Recently released [analogous.app](https://analogous.app), check it out!

I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science 👨🏻‍💻

I am passionate about using innovative software technologies, such as AI and machine learning, to create inclusive tools and applications that focuses on the empowerment and needs of users themselves 🧠

I am also extremely interested in the security and protection of online applications—especially with AI coming into the picture. The intersection between AI and cybersecurity is a major focus for me on my computer science learning journey here at the University of Waterloo 🧩

I am driven by my goal of continuous learning, and am always open to new ideas, advice, or internship/co-op opportunities (for Summer 2025) where I can grow and contribute to an innovative organization or company! 💡

Please feel free to reach out and connect! 👍🏼
